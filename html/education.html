        <h1><strong> Educational Requirements </strong></h1>
        <img src="../img/brain.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
        <h2> Requires a Bachelor Degree if working under the federal government (Mainly Dep of Def) or a PhD otherwise </h2>
        <h3>Usually Possess various skills like:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mathematical Expertise</li>
            <p>Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Physics, all sorts of knowledge in mathematics is required to understand computer systems on a fundamental level (binary) and to create complex mathamatical algorithms to solve problems (Creating 3D Objects, Simulation Software, random number generation, etc).</p>
          <li>Logical Mindset</li>
            <p>No computer can be smarter than a human, yet we often expect them to be. It is important for programmers in general to be able to specify the exact tasks they want the computer to complete, which is of even greater need when developing AI.</p>
          <li>Analytical</li>
            <p>All computer scientists need to break down problems in order to solve them, breaking tasks into small pieces makes them easier to solve, and for that we need to analyze problems. </p>
          <li>Attention to Detail</li>
            <p> The biggest part of computer science, because if there is one bug in your code it can ruin the whole project! Developers need to ensure that code is clean and organized, as well as well documented, to prevent frustrating bugs in software. </p>
          <li>Self-Awareness</li>
            <p> Computer Scientists need to be in control of their mental state as frustration is common when dealing with computers. Frustration is the biggest source of failure in the computer science world.</p>
          <li>Communication</li>
            <p> Projects are often done in collaboration with other co-workers and if plans are not clear, projects will become buggy and incomplete.</p>
          <li>Creativity</li>
            <p> It is rare for things to go as planned when working with new ideas, scientists need to be able to find many different solutions to a computer problem in order to solve it efficiently.</p>
        </ul>
